# CUSTOMIZABLE EXPORT MAPPINGS

In order to support custom implementations it is possible to completely rewrite Speechr's scripting syntax text at export to conform the target language.

For example, for C#, you could theoretically map `<Commands>` to standard C# classes and use reflection to avoid writing any parser at all!
