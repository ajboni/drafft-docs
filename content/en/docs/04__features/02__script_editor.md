# SCRIPTING

Drafft's powerful script editor uses simple plain text to tell your game's characters exactly what to do and how to do it. With highlighted syntax keeping everything easy to read, Drafft's scripting is a joy to use.

Drafft supports scripting in several languages complimenting each one with its very simple own speech language which helps to extract and identify text for voice-overs, emotions, commands and functions.

Everything is converted to standard JSON when exporting, making the import process on the game engine quite straightforward.

## Screenplays

It also features auto generated standard screenplay documents.
