# POWERFUL DIALOGUE TREE EDITOR

> Non-Linear Branching Tree Graph or Scripts?

After researching many methods for displaying complex non-linear dialogue, I found that the combination of both worlds is necessary:
A tree structure to show the flow and branching of the scene **and** a scripting editor that does not force the user to write in tiny boxes.

Complex scenes can be made without cluttering the screen with tree nodes, but at the same time having a visual representation really helps to visualize all the possible outcomes.
