# CONSTANT DEVELOPMENT

Drafft is in constant development, future updates will (hopefully) include:

- Key Ring: This section will have a tree structure(much like everything else) where you will be able to mass import licence keys for services(steam, itch.io, etc) and then you will be able to assign it to users and mark them as used.Keys should be encrypted.
- Localization Scripts and Dialogues needs to be imported/written and exported in different languages.
- Conversation Simulator: Just fire up your dialogue and test it in a simulation, useful for quick trying different ideas.
- presskit() generator.
- Dark Mode! (currently in beta)
