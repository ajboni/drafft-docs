Work in progress.\n\n> If you want to contribute your project to this section, please make a pull\n> request on the examples repo [https://github.com/ajboni/drafft-examples]\n\n\nIMPORTING A PROJECT. ¶\n\n 1. Download the example project json file: for this document we will use The\n    goddess of fate\n    [https://github.com/ajboni/drafft-examples/blob/main/projects/The%20goddess%20of%20fate..json]:\n    A Dialogue based visual novel about the zodiac.\n 2. Launch the app.\n 3. Go to Project Manager and click on Restore Database from file in a new\n    project\n 4. Enter a name and click ok.\n 5. Select the json file. The project will load.\n\n\nSECTIONS ¶\n\nThe left sidebar content will change with all available modules of the app, we\nwill quickly visit each one to get a general overview of the features.\n\n\nOPTIONS ¶\n\nYou should setup your username here if you are planning to use it in a team.\nOther options are self explanatory.\n\n\nPROJECT MANAGER ¶\n\nThis is where you can create, load, delete and restore projects. Not much to do\nhere now.\n\n\nPROJECT SETTINGS ¶\n\nThis is where you can set up project options and metadata and certain default\nbehaviours.\nA very important section here is the Export Options page where you can set up\ndifferent mappings that will be applied when generating the game export as well\nas what sections will be exported.\n\n\nDESIGN DOCUMENTS ¶\n\nHere is the place where to add documents, notes, story bits, etc. You will\nnotice the loaded project has a “summary” document, if you try to edit it you\nwill not be able to do so. That’s because the document is not “locked for\nediting”.\n\n\nEDITING DOCUMENTS ¶\n\nDrafft supports realtime collaboration, with the condition that each user\n“locks” the document that they are working on to avoid concurrency issues.\nEven when using the app as a single user, each document will need to be locked\nbefore it being able to be modified.\n\nGo ahead and click the edit button on the toolbar. Some actions on the toolbar\nlike delete or rename will be available now. Also notice that there should be a\npadlock icon with your username simbolizing the status of the document.\n\n> You can double-click on the doc text to unlock the document (works also on\n> scripts).\n\nMake some changes to the file and click the save button. The file icon should\ndisappear and the file will be available to other user.\n\nYou can have a play exploring the file creation or editing processes, also take\na look at the timeline feature if you want. Once ready lets move to the script\nsection.\n\n\nSCRIPTS ¶\n\nThis is one of the main sections of the app, a script is data that you will\nprovide to your game and it can be written in any language.\nA script could be a standalone document or be part of a dialogue tree. Instead\nof relying on writing int each dialogue tree node, each node will have its own\nscript attached, but more on that later.\nYou will notice two items in the file tree: goToLibrary is a really simple\nscript executing a command and a special read-only “Dialogues” folder which\ncontains all scripts that are part of a dialogue Documents, lets ignore that for\nnow.\n\n * Select goToLibrary and double-click on the text area. Press the Toggle editor\n   hotkeys panel button. This will open a sidebar on the right with some\n   shortcuts, these will be really useful for repetitive tasks like adding\n   speech actions.\n * Modify ctrl+4 shortcut and add the following: ::Narrator:: % deals % damage.\n * Focus the text area and press ctrl+4. Each time a % appears in the shortcut\n   it will ask the user for a value. Put Max and 66 or whatever you want there.\n\nYou will also notice that <PlayDialogueByAlias(area)> and ::Narrator:: are\nhighlighted differently and that is because they are part of the really small\nDrafft Scripting Syntax [scripting.html].

So you\nare allowed to use whatever language you prefer for your scripts. However, there\nare certain features that, due to its nature, need to be able to identify the\npurpose of the line. For this purpose the drafft syntax (UAF) was created. It is\nused for very specific purposes and can be ignored if not needed:\n\n\nCOMMANDS ¶\n\nCommands are just functions. The benefit of using drafft syntax is that they\nwill appear in the resulting screenplay [screenplay_generation.html]\n\n<Commands(param, param)>\n\n\nSPECIAL CASES ¶\n\nFade commands <FadeOut(?params)> and <FadeIn(?params)> also get some special\ntreatment in the screenplay output.\n\n\nEXAMPLES: ¶\n\n<Wait(5)>\n<Focus(actor)>\n<FadeOut()>\n<WalkTo(x,y,z)>\n\n\nCommands can also be renamed at export to a syntax more useful for the target\nengine. See Export Mappings [exporting.html]\n\n\nACTOR LINE (WITH SPEECH TAG) ¶\n\n::Actor::Actor Line [expression] or [#speechTag] ::Actor::Actor Line\n[expression]\n\nThis is the most important concept in drafft, this line represent a line of\nspeech an actor says. It has several uses:\n\n * Identifying actors to make the actor database.\n * Identifying speech lines to auto generate tags for voice-overs.\n * Include this line on the resulting screenplay.\n * Include expressions in screenplay.\n\nActor lines can also be renamed at export to a syntax more useful for the target\nengine. See Export Mappings [exporting.html]\n\n\nEXAMPLES: ¶\n\n::Tyler::The first rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club.[serious]\n[#line001]::Travis::You talkin' to me?\n\n\n\n\nCOMMENTS ¶\n\n// Comment\n\nComments are lines that are commonly ignored in the target engine. Drafft will\ninclude comments in the screenplay [screenplay_generation.html].\n\n\nEXAMPLE ¶\n\n// INT. SUBURBAN HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT\n// FILBERT (9), wiry, lost in his own imaginary world. Dressed as a Knight.

We can replicate in real-time,\nbut with the condition that no 2 users are modifying the same item.\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS ¶\n\n * A couchdb [https://couchdb.apache.org/] server, with admin permissions. A\n   dedicated server for drafft is recommended. The easiest way to get it running\n   is using the official docker image [https://hub.docker.com/_/couchdb/]\n * Connectivity of each computer to the server.\n * Each user should have a distinctive username\n * Each user should init a project with the same name.\n\n\nENABLING REMOTE SYNC ¶\n\n 1. First a user set up a project and give it a name. eg: ‘multiuser’\n 2. In options section, they setup a unique username.\n 3. In project settings => remote replication section, they enable the feature\n    and input the database url (must include http(s)😕\n    [https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/14.0.2/72x72/1f615.png]/)\n 4. Every other user repeats the same procedure.\n 5. profit.\n\n\nSYNC ISSUES ¶\n\nAlthough the process is simple and it’s quite tested, certain networking\nconditions, or a user working offline, could potentially overwrite another\nuser’s work if they work on the same item. It is recommended that the\nmodifications are done when online or that the team organize the workflow to\navoid such issues.\n\nRemember that making backups is always a good practice.\n\n\nNOTES ¶\n\n * Couchdb doesn’t allow capital letters so drafft doesnt allow it either (when\n   you create it uppercase the databse name will be renamed to lowercase).\n * All table names will appear as drafft_project_name_lowercase\n * CORS must be enabled in couchdb: https://docs.couchdb.org/en/1.3.0/cors.html\n   [https://docs.couchdb.org/en/1.3.0/cors.html]\n * Database url MUST start with http:// or https://\n\n\nVIDEO ¶","n":0.058},"1":{"v":"Drafft Multiuser Feature · Drafft","n":0.447},"2":{"v":"/en/docs/documentation/multiuser.html","n":1}}},{"i":17,"$":{"0":{"v":"EXPORTING ¶\n\nIn order to use drafft database in a game engine, an export needs to be done.
