One Bullet\n    [https://github.com/ajboni/drafft-examples/blob/main/projects/One%20Bullet.json]:\n    A Mockup for a point and click game about a heist. Work in progress.\n\n> If you want to contribute your project to this section, please make a pull\n> request on the examples repo [https://github.com/ajboni/drafft-examples]\n\n\nIMPORTING A PROJECT. ¶\n\n 1. Download the example project json file: for this document we will use The\n    goddess of fate\n    [https://github.com/ajboni/drafft-examples/blob/main/projects/The%20goddess%20of%20fate..json]:\n    A Dialogue based visual novel about the zodiac.\n 2. Launch the app.\n 3. Go to Project Manager and click on Restore Database from file in a new\n    project\n 4. Enter a name and click ok.\n 5. Select the json file. The project will load.\n\n\nSECTIONS ¶\n\nThe left sidebar content will change with all available modules of the app, we\nwill quickly visit each one to get a general overview of the features.\n\n\nOPTIONS ¶\n\nYou should setup your username here if you are planning to use it in a team.\nOther options are self explanatory.\n\n\nPROJECT MANAGER ¶\n\nThis is where you can create, load, delete and restore projects. Not much to do\nhere now.\n\n\nPROJECT SETTINGS ¶\n\nThis is where you can set up project options and metadata and certain default\nbehaviours.\nA very important section here is the Export Options page where you can set up\ndifferent mappings that will be applied when generating the game export as well\nas what sections will be exported.\n\n\nDESIGN DOCUMENTS ¶\n\nHere is the place where to add documents, notes, story bits, etc. You will\nnotice the loaded project has a “summary” document, if you try to edit it you\nwill not be able to do so. That’s because the document is not “locked for\nediting”.\n\n\nEDITING DOCUMENTS ¶\n\nDrafft supports realtime collaboration, with the condition that each user\n“locks” the document that they are working on to avoid concurrency issues.\nEven when using the app as a single user, each document will need to be locked\nbefore it being able to be modified.\n\nGo ahead and click the edit button on the toolbar. Some actions on the toolbar\nlike delete or rename will be available now. Also notice that there should be a\npadlock icon with your username simbolizing the status of the document.\n\n> You can double-click on the doc text to lock the document (works also on\n> scripts).\n\nMake some changes to the file and click the save button. The file icon should\ndisappear and the file will be available to other user.\n\nYou can have a play exploring the file creation or editing processes, also take\na look at the timeline feature if you want. Once ready lets move to the script\nsection.\n\n\nSCRIPTS ¶\n\nThis is one of the main sections of the app, a script is data that you will\nprovide to your game and it can be written in any language.\nA script could be a standalone document or be part of a dialogue tree. Instead\nof relying on writing int each dialogue tree node, each node will have its own\nscript attached, but more on that later.\nYou will notice two items in the file tree: goToLibrary is a really simple\nscript executing a command and a special read-only “Dialogues” folder which\ncontains all scripts that are part of a dialogue Documents, lets ignore that for\nnow.\n\n * Select goToLibrary and double-click on the text area. Press the Toggle editor\n   hotkeys panel button. This will open a sidebar on the right with some\n   shortcuts, these will be really useful for repetitive tasks like adding\n   speech actions.\n * Modify ctrl+4 shortcut and add the following: ::Narrator:: % deals % damage.\n * Focus the text area and press ctrl+4. Each time a % appears in the shortcut\n   it will ask the user for a value. Put Max and 66 or whatever you want there.\n\nYou will also notice that <PlayDialogueByAlias(area)> and ::Narrator:: are\nhighlighted differently and that is because they are part of the really small\nDrafft Scripting Syntax [scripting.html]. Go have a read on that page document\nfor a quick overview. I’ll wait…\n\nAlso note that this script has and id and an alias shown in the script editor\nfooter.\n\n\nDIALOGUES ¶\n\nThe script concept can also be applied to dialogues. Drafft will give the chance\nto design a dialogue tree with the possibility to attach a script to each node.\nThe way of structuring a dialogue tree is up to you, but the intended idea is to\ndo linear logic inside the script, and use the tree as a branching mechanism.\nThis will make the tree less convoluted.\n\nA dialogue tree consist in a series of nodes interconnected (or not). Drafft\nprovides 5 different nodes which should be enough to implement any logic in\ncombination with a script.\n\n * Start node its a 1 Output node, its intended usage is for the developer to\n   identify where to position the dialogue when starting it.\n * Script node is a 1 Input -> 1 Output node that carries an associated script.\n   This is intended for running game logic or linear dialogue.\n * Choice node is a 1 Input -> n Outputs node intended for branching logic.\n * End nodes is a 1 Input only node intended to provide a flag on where a branch\n   hit a dead.\n * Similarly the Return node is 1 Input only node intended to provide aflags on\n   where a branch hit a dead and should return to the choice node, or any other\n   custom logic. This is to avoid populating the graph with lots of arrows going\n   back.\n\n> Even though the script node is intended to provide scripting logic, any node\n> can have a linked script.\n\n[/img/tutorial-03.png]\n\nGo to the Dialogues section and load the Aries - 01 - Aries Ecounter dialogue\nand click each node to inspect the associated script. Feel free to experiment\nediting and moving/linking nodes.\n\n[/img/tutorial-04.png]\n\nWith the document locked for edits, select the first node , the green starting\nnode and add a few lines at the start:\n\n::Mother:: I saw Kenji walking all day looking for something.\n::Mother:: Maybe he has a new job.\n::Mother:: [Happy] Finally!\n\n\n\nDETECTING ACTORS ¶\n\nIn order to update the Actor database we can simply click the Auto Detect Actors\nbutton in the toolbar. Click it, we will come back to this later. You should see\na message with the text: “Added 1 Actors: Mother”\n\n[/img/tutorial-auto-detecting-actors.png]\n\n\nGENERATION VOICE OVER TAGS ¶\n\nAs we are using the Drafft Scripting Syntax (UAF) we can automatically generate\na tag for each dialogue line, so in the future we can link our audio files with\neach line. This has the trade off to have the script filled with tags but on the\nother hand we don’t need any kind of metadata db for each line which would\nprobably make the editing experience more tedious. This tag can be of format but\nUAF identifies them with the following format: [#speechTag]::Actor::Actor Line\n[expression]\n\nIn order to keep that short, unique and identifiable , a combination of the\nscript alias and a short uuid is used for the generation. Go ahead a click the\n“Generate tags for current script” button. A success message should appear.\n\nReopen the node script to see the changes:\n\n[/img/tutorial-voice-over-tag-generation.png]\n\n\nPREVIEWING DIALOGUE ¶\n\nDrafft comes with a VERY basic dialogue and script player. With the dialogue\nselected click the Play Dialogue button.\n\nIn this screen basic navigation can be done to debug the dialogue logic.\n\nPreview Dialogue Tree [/img/tutorial-preview-dialogue-tree.png]\n\nAnother benefit of using Drafft Scripting Syntax [scripting.html] is that t can\nmake the previewing process a bit nicer ignoring non-dialogue and getting actors\nportraits and emotions. The speech only button will only move to ::ActorTag::\nlines.\n\n> Clicking on the text box will advance to the next line.\n\n\nDIRECTOR SECTION ¶\n\nIn the Director section we will find a list of Actors and properties that we can\nfill for our game.\n\nYou should see Mother was added to the list. If you click on the tree item and\nlock the document you can add data in the different tabs.\n\nBIO ¶\n\nWrite a biography or any relevant rich text in the bio tab.\n\nPROPERTIES ¶\n\nIn this tab you can add plain text or structured data in hjson, json toml. If\nthe latter this data will be serialized as JSON when generating the game export.\n\nName, age and gender are automatically created at random when a new actor is\ndetected.\n\nEXPRESSIONS ¶\n\nA list of images to use when a script using UAF calls an expression\n[expression]. In hour example before we added [happy] so go ahead and click on\nAdd Expression an add a picture for the happy expression.\n\n[/img/tutorial-adding-actor-expression.png]\n\n> Expressions are saved in lower case in the database, thus the matching is\n> case-insensitive.\n\nWe can now go and test our script in the player, but , first, take a look at the\nremaining tabs.\n\nTAGGED/SPEECH SCRIPTS ¶\n\nThese tabs display all scripts associated with an actor. Tagged scripts will\nonly show lines which contains [#tag] tags. Useful for example, to generate\nexports for voice actors.\n\nYou will notice that there is a comment before the lines indicating the script\nid , alias, and node name.\n\nActor tagged scripts [/img/tutorial-actor-tagged-scripts.png]\n\nWe can navigate to the dialogue or we can use the node name to identify the\nscript in the script section (Remember, the dialogue node contains a linked\nscript)\n\nThere is a special read-only folder inside the script section which includes all\nthe dialogue scripts grouped by dialogue.\n\nActor script player [/img/tutorial-dialogue-script-player.png]\n\nThis section also contains a script player, but only scoped to the current\nscript. Go ahead an try the new Mother expression.\n\nActor Expression in Script Player\n[/img/tutorial-actor-expression-in-script-player.png]\n\n\nSCREENPLAYS ¶\n\nWhile we are here, you can click on Screenplay toolbar button, to see/download\nthe current screenplay in a script format. This particular project does not\ncontains much screenplay comments but there is more info in the docs\n[/en/docs/documentation/screenplay_generation.html]\n\nTo Be continued…\n\n> In the meantime, if you need help please visit the Drafft forums\n> [https://baj.itch.io/drafft/community]"},{"url":"/en/docs/documentation/scripting.html","title":"Drafft Scripting Syntax","plainTextContent":"SCRIPTING SYNTAX ¶\n\nThe idea behind drafft is that it should be engine and language agnostic. So you\nare allowed to use whatever language you prefer for your scripts. However, there\nare certain features that, due to its nature, need to be able to identify the\npurpose of the line. For this purpose the drafft syntax (UAF) was created. It is\nused for very specific purposes and can be ignored if not needed:\n\n\nCOMMANDS ¶\n\nCommands are just functions. The benefit of using drafft syntax is that they\nwill appear in the resulting screenplay [screenplay_generation.html]\n\n<Commands(param, param)>\n\n\nSPECIAL CASES ¶\n\nFade commands <FadeOut(?params)> and <FadeIn(?params)> also get some special\ntreatment in the screenplay output.\n\n\nEXAMPLES: ¶\n\n<Wait(5)>\n<Focus(actor)>\n<FadeOut()>\n<WalkTo(x,y,z)>\n\n\nCommands can also be renamed at export to a syntax more useful for the target\nengine. See Export Mappings [exporting.html]\n\n\nACTOR LINE (WITH SPEECH TAG) ¶\n\n::Actor::Actor Line [expression] or [#speechTag] ::Actor::Actor Line\n[expression]\n\nThis is the most important concept in drafft, this line represent a line of\nspeech an actor says. It has several uses:\n\n * Identifying actors to make the actor database.\n * Identifying speech lines to auto generate tags for voice-overs.\n * Include this line on the resulting screenplay.\n * Include expressions in screenplay.\n\nActor lines can also be renamed at export to a syntax more useful for the target\nengine. See Export Mappings [exporting.html]\n\n\nEXAMPLES: ¶\n\n::Tyler::The first rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club.[serious]\n[#line001]::Travis::You talkin' to me?\n\n\n\n\nCOMMENTS ¶\n\n// Comment\n\nComments are lines that are commonly ignored in the target engine. Drafft will\ninclude comments in the screenplay [screenplay_generation.html].\n\n\nEXAMPLE ¶\n\n// INT. SUBURBAN HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT\n// FILBERT (9), wiry, lost in his own imaginary world.
